  description: "It's a car accident report. \nDate: August 15th, exactly 2 years
    ago. \nDetails: \"Based on witness accounts, the deceased driver did not see
    the lost pet until it was too late. Not only did it hit it, but the swerve caused
    him to hit the side of the neighboring car, injuring the driver. Despite the
    deceased having the potential to make it to the hospital, he died on impact\""
